# Discrete Fourier Transforms
Code written in C that performs discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) and inverse discrete Fourier transforms (IDFTs) of complex functions.

## Introduction
This was a second-year project as part of my MPhys Physics degree. It involved writing code in C to be able to handle complex functions, and perform DFTs and IDFTs to these functions. Two of these functions were defined in the code and sampled at discrete time intervals and a third was obtained from a provided text file with raw data values. Python was used for plotting graphs of the data and comparing the results.

## Mathematical Background
Define three functions
