# Discrete Fourier Transforms
Code written in C that performs discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) and inverse discrete Fourier transforms (IDFTs) of complex functions.

## Introduction
This was a second-year project as part of my MPhys Physics degree. It involved writing code in C to be able to handle complex functions, and perform DFTs and IDFTs to these functions. Two of these functions were defined in the code and sampled at discrete time intervals and a third was obtained from a provided text file with raw data values. Python was used for plotting graphs of the data and comparing the results.

## Mathematical Background
The functions h1(t) and h2(t) are given below.

## File Structure
The C code is contained within FourierTransforms.c and the code used to plot the figures is contained within Graphs.py. The raw data files and data produced from the IDFTs can be found in the DataFiles folder. The figures plotted using Python are located in the Figures folder.
